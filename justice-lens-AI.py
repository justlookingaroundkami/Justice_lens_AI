Welcome to **Justice Lens AI**, a civic technology prototype that demonstrates how artificial intelligence can contribute to criminal case evaluations. 

While real-world courts are shaped by laws, history, politics, and human judgment, this app explores an alternative: what would it look like if an AI attempted to judge using purely neutral, ethical reasoning based on case facts?

Explore real, controversial criminal cases ‚Äî some where human decisions were arguably biased ‚Äî and compare your judgment with that of an AI attempting neutrality.
